      Some English words sound are <b>iconic</b>. Their form resembles their meaning. For example, SLURP sounds like the noise made when you perform this kind of drinking action. TEENY <em>seems</em> like something very small (compared to HUGE which seems like something big). You might be able to guess the meaning of such words <em>even if</em> you did not speak English.      
      ${continue_space}`,

      `<p class="lead"></b></p> 
      In this task, you are going to rate words for how much words resemble their meanings on a scale from 1 to 7. A rating of 1 indicates that the form of the word does not at all resemble its meaning. 7 indicates that the form of the word very much resembles its meaning. You can use the number keys on your keyboard, or the mouse to respond.
      ${continue_space}`,

      `<p class="lead"></b></p> 
      Some words that people have been rated high in iconicity are CLICK, SCREECH, and STOMP. Some words that people have rated moderate in iconicity are PORCUPINE, GLOWING, and STEEP. Some words rated low in iconicity are MENU, AMATEUR, and ARE.     
      ${continue_space}`,

      `<p class="lead"></b></p>
