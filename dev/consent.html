The HIT you are about to do is sponsored by University of Wisconsin-Madison. It is part of a protocol titled “Language and Human Cognition”.
The task you are asked to do involves making simple responses to images, text, and/or sounds. For example, you may be asked how typical a picture of a dog is of dogs in general, to name a drawing, decide what word a sound makes you think of, to choose which visual pattern best completes a sequence of patterns, or indicate how vividly you see in your “mind’s eye.” 
 <strong>HIT instructions will be provided on the next screen. </strong>

HOW WILL MY CONFIDENTIALITY BE PROTECTED? This research is covered by a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health. The researchers with this Certificate may not disclose or use information, documents, or biospecimens that may identify you in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other action, suit, or proceeding, or be used as evidence, for example, if there is a court subpoena, unless you have consented for this use. Information, documents, or biospecimens protected by this Certificate cannot be disclosed to anyone else who is not connected with the research except, if there is a federal, state, or local law that requires disclosure (such as to report child abuse or communicable diseases but not for federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings, see below); if you have consented to the disclosure, including for your medical treatment; or if it is used for other scientific research, as allowed by federal regulations protecting research subjects.
You are free to decline to participate, to end participation at any time for any reason, or to refuse to answer any individual question without penalty or loss of earned compensation.</font>
